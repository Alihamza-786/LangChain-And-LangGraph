Katahdin logo patch. For care, machine wash and dry. Imported.<<<<>>>>>: 854\\nname: Urban Striped Quarter-Zip Terry Pullover\\ndescription: Our all-cotton french terry quarter-zip is designed with appealing texture, a versatile season-spanning weight and nautical-inspired stripes. Size & Fit: Slim Fit - cut slim through the chest, sleeve and waist. Why We Love It: We've turned the typical sweatshirt inside out. Our pullover features the reverse side of our french terry fabric on the outside for outstanding texture, while the inside is nice and smooth. It has the undeniable comfort of cotton, with a neater look than most sweatshirts and a modern, slimmer fit. Our striped pullover is the perfect weekend layer, especially between seasons - and we love the side pockets! Fabric & Care: 100% cotton in a French terry knit. Machine wash and dry. Additional Features: Sturdy metal zipper adds to its rugged appeal. On-seam side pockets. Ribbed cuffs keep their shape. Side vents at hem.
